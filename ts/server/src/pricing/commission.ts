/**
 * Commission lookup by (channel, jurisdiction).
 *
 * Directly implements the meditation-pal-8sj ADDENDUM: commission is NOT a
 * constant — it's a knob keyed by how the money arrived and where the buyer
 * is. The metered margin multiplier (meter.ts) must be validated AGAINST this
 * so net margin stays positive on every channel, including the 15% IAP floor.
 *
 * These rates are deliberately in the open-source tree. aloud publishes its
 * margin (see README) — a user motivated enough to audit it had two cheaper
 * escape hatches (local Ollama, bring-your-own-key). Transparency here is a
 * trust feature, not a leak.
 *
 * ⚠️ The US web ~0% path is LEGALLY UNSETTLED (Epic v. Apple remand; Apple
 * seeking SCOTUS review, rehearing denied Mar-2026). 0% is today's best case,
 * not a permanent assumption. The knob is what protects us if it changes —
 * re-verify before relying on it (meditation-pal-czr).
