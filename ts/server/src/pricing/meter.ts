/**
 * The metered-billing core (meditation-pal-8sj): price each unit of usage by
 * its ACTUAL underlying provider cost, debited from a credit balance. Metered
 * debit is the direct fix for the cost-math trap meditation-pal-a2j flags — a
 * daily power user's heavy use can never run at a loss, because every token
 * they burn is debited at real cost, not amortized against a flat subscription.
 *
 * Money model (Model B — margin lives at PURCHASE, not in the debit):
 *   - 1 credit = USD_PER_CREDIT of PROVIDER COST (what we pay). The debit is at
 *     cost: credits_spent = providerCostUsd / USD_PER_CREDIT. No markup here.
 *   - Margin is applied when CREDITS ARE SOLD: a pack of N credits funds
 *     N * USD_PER_CREDIT of provider cost, and sells for that * PACK_MARKUP
 *     (see billing/stripe.ts). Markup is visible at checkout — the most
 *     transparent place to put it — and sales tax/VAT is collected on top via
 *     Stripe Tax (not absorbed from margin).
 *   - Net of the ~$0.05 cost basis and a ~2.5x pack markup, the user pays
 *     ~$0.125/credit at purchase. Keeping margin out of the debit means the
 *     per-session credit counts the user watches tick down map 1:1 to real
 *     compute cost — easy to verify, on-brand for the published-margin stance.
 *
 * Solvency (the addendum's "must clear positive margin at the 15% IAP floor"):
 * net pack revenue after commission must exceed the provider cost the sold
 * credits fund, i.e. effective pack markup >= 1 / (1 - commission). 15% IAP
 * needs >=1.176x; 18% EU >=1.22x; 30% >=1.43x. assertSolvent() enforces this at
 * boot against every pack and channel.
