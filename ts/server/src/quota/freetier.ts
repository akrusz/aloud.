/**
 * Free-tier gating + abuse controls (meditation-pal-2yb). The web demo has a
 * wide-open abuse surface (no app-store gating), so this is load-bearing.
 *
 * Two cheap levers implemented here; the heavier ones (device fingerprinting,
 * disposable-domain blocklists, velocity scoring) attach at these same seams:
 *   1. Signup grant is gated on a VERIFIED Google email (the verification
 *      itself happens in auth/google.ts). An unverified identity gets an
 *      account but zero free credits — so farming throwaway addresses yields
 *      nothing spendable.
 *   2. A per-account request-rate ceiling caps burst abuse and runaway clients.
 *      In-memory sliding window here; swap for Redis when the backend goes
 *      multi-instance (meditation-pal-a3u notes sticky-sessions/Redis only
 *      matter once stateful).

 * Global free-grant circuit breaker (meditation-pal-kq4) — the emergency brake

 * the window drains. Deliberately lean: in-memory sliding sum, no persistence
 * (a restart resets it, which is fine for a brake whose whole job is to blunt a
