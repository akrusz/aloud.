 * billing/credits, and the metered LLM/STT/TTS forwarding those credits buy.
 *
 * Dev: the UI calls relative `/cloud/v1/...` paths and the Vite proxy forwards
 * them to the server (ui/vite.config.ts). A deployed static build has no proxy,
 * so it needs the absolute server origin, baked in at build time via
 * VITE_ALOUD_SERVER_URL (e.g. `VITE_ALOUD_SERVER_URL=https://api.aloud.example
 * npm run ui:build`). Leave it unset for dev and for any deploy where the static
 * host reverse-proxies /cloud to the server on the same origin.
 *
 * Mirrors `app-base.ts` (the app's own `/app/v1/*` backend); the same origin
 * serves both surfaces on web, so they share VITE_ALOUD_SERVER_URL.
