/**
 * Runtime "is this a desktop environment" detection.
 *
 * "Desktop" = the app backend reports it's a local/desktop backend. We probe
 * /app/v1/system-info at boot: the native Rust shell and the dev Flask backend
 * are desktop (they expose claude_proxy, the Ollama proxy, config-folder shell
 * escapes); the hosted web backend answers `desktop:false` so those features
 * stay off there. The signal is the `desktop` field — NOT mere reachability,
 * since the web Hono also answers /app/v1/system-info (with desktop:false). A
 * response that omits the field (e.g. older Flask) counts as desktop, to keep
 * the existing browser-against-Flask dev behavior. Views read isDesktop() for
 * gating desktop-only features (claude_proxy provider, env-var hints, the Open
 * config folder button).
 *
 * Result is monotonic: once we've decided "desktop", we stick with it
 * for the session. If the backend flaps down between probes we'd rather not
 * yank the controls.
