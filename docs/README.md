# aloud. landing page

Static site for the public aloud. landing page. Hand-written; no build step.

This folder is named `docs/` because GitHub Pages serves from `/docs` on main. Internal developer documentation (build instructions, style guide, etc.) lives in `dev-docs/` at the repo root.

## structure

```
docs/
  index.html      ← page content + structure
  css/style.css   ← brand tokens lifted from dev-docs/style.md
  js/download.js  ← fetches latest GitHub release at page load
  js/theme.js     ← light/dark toggle (persists choice for 4h, else follows OS)
  assets/
    aloud.png               ← icon (favicon + og:image)
    aloud-screen-light.webp ← screenshot, light theme
    aloud-screen-dark.webp  ← screenshot, dark theme
```

The screenshots are theme-aware: `js/theme.js` swaps the `#app-screenshot`
`src` to match the active theme, so only one image loads per visit. The repo
README points at the same two files via a `<picture>` element.

## local preview

Any static server. From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server -d docs 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## download wiring

`js/download.js` calls `https://api.github.com/repos/akrusz/aloud/releases/latest`
on page load and rewrites the three download-card `href`s with the latest
release asset URLs. If the API fails (rate-limited, offline, etc.) it falls
back to `https://github.com/akrusz/aloud/releases/latest` for all three.

This means the site never needs to be re-deployed when a new version ships
— `scripts/release.sh` triggers the build workflow, the workflow uploads
assets, the next page load picks them up.

## deployment

Two reasonable paths:

### Porkbun static hosting (pulls from this repo)

Point Porkbun's static site setting at the `docs/` subfolder of this repo
and the default branch. It will serve directly from there. No build step.

### GitHub Pages (free)

In repo settings → Pages, set source to "Deploy from a branch", branch
`main`, folder `/docs`. Custom domain via CNAME if desired.

## brand assets

`assets/aloud.png` is copied from `assets/aloud.png` at the repo root. The
theme screenshots (`assets/aloud-screen-{light,dark}.webp`) are the canonical
copies — the repo README references them from here too, so there's no separate
source to keep in sync. They're downscaled to 1800px wide and WebP-encoded
(`cwebp -q 82 -resize 1800 0`) from full-res PNG exports.

## things to fill in

- [ ] real "buy me a coffee" / Ko-fi URL in `index.html`
      (currently `href="#"` placeholder for the second tip button)
- [ ] confirm GitHub Sponsors page exists at `github.com/sponsors/akrusz`
      or replace with the real sponsorship link
- [ ] consider a slightly nicer og:image (the icon works but a custom
      1200×630 social card would render better in link previews)
