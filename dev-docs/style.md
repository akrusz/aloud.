# aloud. — visual identity

Reference for the brand and color system locked in 2026-05-19. When in doubt, prefer this doc over what's "natural" to grep — the palette is deliberately loud, and previous warm/amber values still appear in places that were missed.

## Brand name usage

- **`aloud.`** (with terminal period) — titles, page `<title>`s, headers, logo, About modal, anywhere the brand is rendered as identity.
- **`aloud`** (no period) — mid-sentence prose, e.g. "Choose how aloud connects to a language model."
- Repo: `github.com/akrusz/aloud` (no period — the trademark display has the period; the repo doesn't, to avoid awkward `aloud..git` URLs).
- macOS bundle id: `app.aloud.meditation`.

## Logo

The brand mark is **Knewave**, a chunky display font. **Use Knewave ONLY for the logo** — `.nav-brand`, `.about-app-name`, and the inline `.brand-mark` span. Everything else (settings titles, welcome headers, h1–h6) stays in the body font.

Logo treatment:

- **Fill**: `var(--accent)` (pink)
- **Stroke**: `var(--brand-stroke)` (yellow), via `-webkit-text-stroke` + `paint-order: stroke fill` so the stroke renders *outside* the letters (doesn't eat into the fill).
- **Stroke widths scale with size**: 2px on `.brand-mark` (inline, ~1.4em of surrounding text), 3px on `.nav-brand` (1.8rem), 4px on `.about-app-name` (2.4rem). Hover on `.nav-brand` thickens to 4px.
- **Letter-spacing**: `0.05em` on nav/about, `0.04em` inline.
- **No text-shadow glow.** Stroke replaces it — we experimented with both, stroke won.

When the brand appears inline in body copy (welcome cards, hints), use `<span class="brand-mark">aloud.</span>` rather than a heading. The class sizes it at `1.4em` relative to surroundings so Knewave reads at proper brand presence without breaking the line.

## Color tokens

All in `src/web/static/css/style.css` at the top. **Always reference via CSS variables, not hex literals.** Hardcoded hexes still exist in a few places (orb gradients, rgba alpha layers); fine, but new code uses tokens.

### Both themes share

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--accent` | Primary brand color (pink). Borders, button fills, focus, active states. |
| `--accent-hover` | Darker pink for hover/pressed. |
| `--accent-dim` | Accent at low alpha — backgrounds for accent-tinted areas. |
| `--accent-glow` | Halo color for tour spotlights, button hover halos, orb breathing, focus rings. **Orange**, not yellow — yellow at low alpha against dim backgrounds blends perceptually toward green. |
| `--brand-stroke` | Yellow used for the logo's outline stroke and the tour-overlay-flat tint. |
| `--brand-glow` | Yellow soft-shadow color — defined but rarely used now that stroke replaced glow on the brand. Keep for future use. |
| `--warm` | Secondary muted gold accent. |

### Light mode

```
--bg-primary:    #fdf4ea   /* warm peach — desaturated #f5a52f */
--bg-secondary:  #f5e6d4
--bg-card:       #ead8c0
--bg-input:      #fffaf2
--bg-surface:    #ffffff
--bg-tertiary:   #efe0cc
--text-primary:  #1f1a18   /* warm near-black */
--text-secondary:#5c4a44
--text-muted:    #756058
--accent:        #e71f75   /* hot pink */
--accent-hover:  #c01560
--accent-glow:   rgba(245, 165, 47, 0.45)   /* orange */
--brand-stroke:  #ffd820   /* bright sunny yellow */

--warm:          #e5a01a
--border:        #e2d0b8
```

### Dark mode

The dark-mode backgrounds are **neutral-warm browns**, not pink-tinted. We tried pink-shifted dark bgs (B≥G in the hex) — they made the pink accent elements read as cool/blue by relative contrast. The current values are restored from the pre-rebrand warm palette and the pink pops cleanly against them.

```
--bg-primary:    #110d08   /* warm dark brown */
--bg-secondary:  #1a1410
--bg-card:       #221a13
--bg-input:      #281f16
--bg-surface:    #2e2419
--bg-tertiary:   #1e1710
--text-primary:  #f5efe6   /* warm off-white */
--text-secondary:#c4b49e
--text-muted:    #b0a090
--accent:        #d63a85   /* muted pink (less harsh on dark) */
--accent-hover:  #c02a72
--accent-glow:   rgba(245, 165, 47, 0.30)   /* same orange, lower alpha */
--brand-stroke:  #e8b820   /* warmer gold */
--brand-glow:    rgba(255, 220, 80, 0.55)
--warm:          #c4a850
--border:        #302618
```

## Orb gradient

Both `.orb` (small, in nav) and `.orb-kasina` (large, click-orb-during-session) use the **same radial gradient**. Single source of truth — if you change one, change both.

```css
background: radial-gradient(circle at 45% 45% in oklab,
    #fff4c0 0%,   /* cream-yellow gazing center */
    #f8f288 18%,  /* pale lemon — keeps the center from snapping to saturated yellow */
    #f5d820 38%,  /* warm yellow band — the dominant "sunny" zone */
    #ffb805 49%,  /* deep gold — anchors the transition into orange */
    #ed7326 65%,  /* burnt orange */
    #e71f75 73%,  /* hot pink — encroaches well inward */
    #870a3e 92%   /* deep magenta — final ring */
);
```

**Interpolating `in oklab`** is load-bearing. sRGB interpolation between yellow and coral runs through muddy olive and produces visible kinks at each stop. oklab interpolates along a perceptually-uniform path between stops, so the curve reads as a smooth arc through warm hues rather than a series of straight segments meeting at angles. Don't strip `in oklab` thinking it's optional; it isn't.

The center cream-yellow is intentionally not pure white — it's slightly tinted (`#fff4c0`) so on dark bgs it doesn't read as a white blob. Stops were tuned through an interactive gradient picker against the perceptual color space, not by hand; if you adjust, do the same. Pink dominates from ~73%-92% with `#870a3e` as the edge (no extra darker stop — letting the deep magenta hold the outer ring keeps the orb's edge from feeling muddy).

Box-shadow halos: orange inner (`var(--accent-glow)` ≈ `#f5a52f`) + pink outer (`rgba(231, 31, 117, 0.22-0.40)` depending on size and pulse state). Kasina has three stacked halos; small orb has two.

**Don't touch** the rainbow easter-egg orb (`.orb-rainbow`) — it's deliberately a multi-color cycle.

## Tour popup styling

Two visual modes:

1. **Spotlighted step** (highlights a UI element): `.tour-spotlight` is positioned over the target, with a `9999px` outer box-shadow at 55% black to dim everything else. Glow ring around the spotlight uses `var(--accent-glow)` (orange).
2. **Welcome / done card** (centered, no spotlight): `.tour-overlay-flat` class added to the overlay via JS (in `showCard()` toggle based on `className === 'tour-welcome'`). Renders a **flat tinted backdrop**: yellow tint via `color-mix(in srgb, var(--brand-stroke) 30%, transparent)`, plus a thin brightness-shift gradient on top (`rgba(0,0,0,0.18)` in light, `rgba(255,255,255,0.18)` in dark) to actually create dim separation. The welcome card itself has **no glow box-shadow** — just a drop shadow.

Don't add a glow halo to `.tour-welcome` — the flat overlay handles separation. Glow rings imply "look here, click this" which the welcome step doesn't offer.

## Embers

Ambient floating particles. Palette per theme, defined in `src/web/static/js/ui.js`:

- **Light mode** (`EMBER_COLORS_LIGHT`): saturated gold-yellows that contrast against the peach bg. Avoid pale yellows like `#f5e060` — they wash into the bg at the 0.7 peak opacity the ember animation targets.
- **Dark mode** (`EMBER_COLORS_DARK`): brighter pure yellows plus one orange (`#f5a52f`) for variety. Avoid pale/cream yellows like `#fff4c0` — they read as white blobs against the dark bg.
- **Rainbow mode** (`EMBER_COLORS_RAINBOW`): pastel rainbow cycle, untouched (paired with the rainbow easter-egg orb).

Halo derived per-ember via `hexGlow()`. Light mode has an `!important` amber box-shadow override on `.ember` that wins regardless of inline color — leave it (the warmth reads well against peach).

## Inline circled `?`

For body copy that references the page's info buttons (tour hints, welcome cards), use `<span class="info-btn-glyph">?</span>`. It's a non-interactive twin of `.info-btn` — same circled-question-mark look, but smaller, with `currentColor` border so it inherits the surrounding text color. Don't use `<strong>?</strong>` (forces line wrap with awkward bolding) or the real `.info-btn` (it's a button with cursor/hover; semantically wrong inline).

## Things to avoid

- **Don't use Knewave outside the three brand classes.** Settings page headers, welcome `<h1>`s, etc. all use the body font.
- **Don't use `#f5f600`** (pure yellow) — it's green-leaning. Use `#ffd820` / `#f5d020` / `#e8b820` family.
- **Don't reintroduce the old warm amber colors** (`#d4873a`, `#e8a840`, `#c07830`, etc.) — they predate the rebrand and don't match anything.
- **Don't pink-tint the dark-mode backgrounds.** Keep them warm-neutral browns. (We tried and the relative contrast made the pink accent look bluer.)
- **Don't add glow rings to `.tour-welcome` cards.** The flat tinted overlay does the separation work.
- **Don't tint `--accent-glow` yellow.** Yellow at low alpha reads green over dim bgs — stay orange.
- **Don't use `text-shadow` for brand glow.** Stroke replaced it.
